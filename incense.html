    <h2>Incense</h2>
    <p>The development of tools for kofun construction laid the foundation for a metalworking industry that has contributed to Sakai's prosperity ever since. Metal tools would have been essential for felling trees to produce the timber that was used to build ships that sailed from Sakai on trade routes to China, the Ryukyu Kingdom, and beyond. Among the items being brought ashore in Sakai in the 15th and 16th centuries was aromatic wood, from which incense could be made for use in religious and cultural pursuits. Incense, too, remains central to Sakai's identity.</p>
